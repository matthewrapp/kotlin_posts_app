# Overview

This app is a simple Android application, that fetches a simple REST api for blog posts and displays its' title. The purpose for writing this software was for me to utilize the little knowledge I know of Kotlin, but add to that by learning how to fetch an external REST api to return back JSON data, and then display it on the screen.
